    <body>
        <div>Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,</div>
        <div>Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,</div>
        <div>Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,</div>
        <div>And towards our distant rest began to trudge.</div>
        <div>Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,</div>
        <div>But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;</div>
        <div>Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots</div>
        <div>Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.</div>
        <br>
        <div>Gas! Gas! Quick, boys! – An ecstasy of fumbling,</div>
        <div>Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;</div>
        <div>But someone still was yelling out and stumbling</div>
        <div>And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime.–</div>
        <div>Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,</div>
        <div>As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.</div>
        <br>
        <div>In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,</div>
        <div>He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</div>
        <br>
        <div>If in some smothering dreams you too could pace</div>
        <div>Behind the wagon that we flung him in,</div>
        <div>And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,</div>
        <div>His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;</div>
        <div>If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood</div>
        <div>Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,</div>
        <div>Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud</div>
        <div>Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,</div>
        <div>My friend, you would not tell with such high zest</div>
        <div>To children ardent for some desperate glory,</div>
        <div>The old Lie: <span style="font-style: italic;">Dulce et decorum est</span></div>
        <div><span style="font-style: italic;">Pro patria mori.</span></div>
